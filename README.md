## Learning Plan for the Coming Year

In the coming year, I plan to focus on learning:

1. **C# and WPF**
2. **Avalonia UI**
3. **Unity**

I will share my learning process and insights on platforms [cnblogs](https://www.cnblogs.com/DuceX). 

I'm sorry my English is very poor so I cannot provide an English version.

You are very welcome to communicate, exchange ideas, and discuss with me!
